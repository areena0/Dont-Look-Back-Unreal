# Don’t Look Back

**Don’t Look Back** is a first-person psychological horror game focused on
atmosphere, tension, and player vulnerability rather than combat.
The experience emphasizes parkour traversal, maze exploration, and
environmental storytelling to create fear through uncertainty and implication.

This repository serves as a **portfolio showcase** of the game’s design,
systems, and visual direction.

## Game Overview

The player is placed into an unsettling environment where survival depends on
movement, awareness, and memory. There are no weapons and no direct combat.
Instead, fear is created through isolation, environmental cues, and the
constant sense of being watched.

The game challenges players to complete precision parkour sections before
navigating a maze-like environment where guidance is intentionally ambiguous,
forcing reliance on observation and intuition.

## Core Gameplay Pillars
- **Psychological Horror** — fear through atmosphere, lighting, and sound
- **Parkour Traversal** — precise movement as a core mechanic
- **Maze Exploration** — navigation and memory under pressure
- **No Combat** — vulnerability as a design choice
- **Environmental Storytelling** — narrative implied through the world itself

---

## Gameplay Structure

The experience is structured into three main phases:

1. **Parkour Challenge**  
   Players must complete a series of movement-based obstacles that test timing,
   spatial awareness, and control.

2. **Maze Exploration**  
   A red-lit maze environment guided by symbolic chess statues creates
   psychological pressure and disorientation while the player searches for
   the Queen to escape.

3. **Final Escape**  
   Once the key is obtained, the player will escape,
   concluding the experience.

## Design Philosophy

- Fear is created through **what is not shown**, rather than explicit enemies
- Player vulnerability increases immersion and tension
- Minimal UI is used to preserve atmosphere
- Level design is used as the primary storytelling tool
- Sound and lighting are critical to emotional impact
